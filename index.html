       <h2>The reasons why is the best club. </h2>
       <p>Firstly, the team has gained success since 1970 decade unquestionably  as the highest champion of Germany and internationally as one of the  biggest in Europe. As a result of tireless work, great desire, ambitious  and team spirit, played and lived by the players, who have used the team  uniform. 
        FC Bayern has faced through some very difficult and hard moments  since its foundation. Especially when the team was marginalized,  discriminated, and lost many members along the difficult situations on  account, World War II. After all, the club did not give up. Otherwise, the  team rise up and position itself as the best team in German football,  doing it by the way that they already know, "winning" and fighting until  the end. 
        Moreover of the things Bayern are most admired , compared to other  clubs, is the way in which the directors manage the club, as they do not  spend the money, in large amounts, but trust the young talents, and in  signing players, with the club philosophy. 
        The team is the fifth most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, and the most popular football club in Germany with 10 million  supporters.

       <h2> Bayern as a role model </h2>
       <p>FC Bayern has been characterized by its German phrase "Mia san Mia",  translated in English as "We are us", which represents the pride and  essence of the club, as stated above, team was despised and victim of  many injustices due to, the Second World War, that is why his phrase  represents an identity to continue acting with the head high and achieve  your goals.  
        Nevertheless, in certain occasions the Club comes to be hated, in  different parts of Germany, even so Bayern manage a philosophy that  the team does not look for to be of the pleasure of all, the team, simply  wants to win all. 
        Finally the club is an example to follow because even though in later  years Bayern was not accepted in the Bundesliga, suffered  discrimination and lost a lot of members, the team was able to overcome  and work hard to achieve all that it has achieved today, the team has not  been given anything, that is why historically the club shows a great life  lesson that we should all have which is not to stop fighting until the end  to reach the top of success. </p>

       <h2>Conclusion</h2>
       <p> In conclusion, through the data obtained and knowing the history of FC  Bayern, conclude that as it has been emphasized FC Bayern is one of  the best clubs in the world, it has a high impact in German Football  being the maximum winner in Germany, no other German club can be  compared to it, but now being objective and knowing the data of other  European teams one could say that because of championships,  statistics and economic power Bayern is not the best club in the world.  But on the other hand historically Bayern should be consider the best  team in the world, because for many years they endured the regime  imposed after the Second World War, lost many players, suffered  discrimination, was totally beaten, but all that made their philosophy  increase, and their desire to win, Bayern München, did not take into  account to participate in the first edition of the Bundesliga, but that did  not defeat the club, on the contrary it gave them more strength to get a  place in the Bundesliga and after years of being crowned the absolute  champion of Germany, that is the reason why FC Bayern is the best  club in the world for not giving up in spite of the circumstances and  keep going, whatever it takes, that's why the fans use the slogan "Mia  san Mia", (We are us), because that includes FC Bayern München, being a unique club that fights until the end to achieve the victory.</p>
